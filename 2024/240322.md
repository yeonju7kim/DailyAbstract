# ENMLP2023 "Medical" Abstract

## Enhancing Biomedical Lay Summarisation with External Knowledge Graphs (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- automatic lay summarisation
- augmenting eLife, an existing biomedical lay summarisation dataset
- incorporating knowledge graphs within lay summarisation models
- integrating graph-based domain knowledge can significantly benefit lay summarisation
- substantially increasing the readability of generated text and improving the explanation of technical concepts
> 계층 요약을 할 때, graph-based domain knowledge를 이용해서 잘 하는 방법

## Appraising The Potential Uses and Harms of LLMs for Medical Systematic Reviews (⭐)
- Medical systematic reviews 중요
- 만드는게 어렵다
- LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate (and potentially misleading) texts by hallucination or omission
- 16 interviews with international systematic review experts to characterize the perceived utility and risks of LLMs
- Experts indicated that LLMs can assist in the writing process by drafting summaries, generating templates, distilling information, and crosschecking information.
- They also raised concerns regarding confidently composed but inaccurate LLM outputs and other potential downstream harms, including decreased accountability and proliferation of low-quality reviews.

## Improving Biomedical Abstractive Summarisation with Knowledge Aggregation from Citation Papers (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- absence of domain-specific background knowledge 때문에 summary하는 것이 어렵다.
- aggregating knowledge from external papers cited within the source article
- novel attention-based citation aggregation model that integrates domain-specific knowledge from citation papers
- large-scale biomedical summarisation dataset 제안

## Biomedical Named Entity Recognition Via Dictionary-based Synonym Generalization (⭐⭐⭐)
- 기존 방식으로는 human effort가 많이 필요
- dictionary-based approaches: extract named entities simply based on a given dictionary
- downside
  - synonym generalization problem: dictionary에 synonym이 없을 때
- Synonym Generalization (SynGen) framework
  - input text에 있는 biomedical concept을 인식해서 span-based predictions을 하는 것
  - 2 regularization term
    - synonym distance regularizer
    - noise perturbation regularizer

## Hierarchical Pretraining on Multimodal Electronic Health Records (⭐⭐⭐) 
- MedHMP
  - specifically designed for hierarchically multimodal EHR data
- existing pretrained models on electronic health records (EHR) fail to capture the hierarchical nature of EHR data

## MedEval: A Multi-Level, Multi-Task, and Multi-Domain Medical Benchmark for Language Model Evaluation (⭐⭐⭐)
- MedEval, a multi-level, multi-task, and multi-domain medical benchmark to facilitate the development of language models for healthcare

## Multilingual Simplification of Medical Texts (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- MultiCochrane
  - sentence-aligned multilingual text simplification dataset for the medical domain in four languages
  - English, Spanish, French, and Farsi
- simple versions of complex texts 하는 task

## A Self-training Framework for Automated Medical Report Generation (⭐⭐⭐) 
- REMOTE (Revisiting sElf-training for Medical repOrT gEneration)
  - exploit the unlabeled medical images and a reference-free evaluation metric MedCLIPScore to augment a small-scale medical report generation dataset for training accurate medical report generation model

## BioFEG: Generate Latent Features for Biomedical Entity Linking (⭐⭐⭐) 
- map entity mentions in biomedical text, such as clinical notes, to standard terms in a given knowledge base
- this task is challenging due to the rarity of many biomedical entities in real-world scenarios
- multiple types of linking errors

## Clinical Contradiction Detection (⭐⭐⭐) 
-  Detecting contradictions in this domain is hard since it requires clinical expertise
-  leverages a medical ontology to build a seed of potential clinical contradictions over 22 million medical abstracts

## Fine-grained Medical Vision-Language Representation Learning for Radiology Report Generation (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) 
- phenotype-driven medical vision-language representation learning framework to efficiently bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities for improved text-oriented generation
- our approach learns more fine-grained representations by contrasting images with each sentence within the reports

## A Comprehensive Evaluation of Biomedical Entity Linking Models (⭐) 
- biomedical entity linking models
- compare models along axes of (1) accuracy, (2) speed, (3) ease of use, (4) generalization, and (5) adaptability to new ontologies and datasets

## An Integrative Survey on Mental Health Conversational Agents to Bridge Computer Science and Medical Perspectives (⭐) 
- Mental health conversational agents

## FaMeSumm: Investigating and Improving Faithfulness of Medical Summarization (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) 
- faithfulness in summarization on a broad range of medical summarization tasks
- FaMeSumm, a framework to improve faithfulness by fine-tuning pre-trained language models based on medical knowledge.

## Controllable Contrastive Generation for Multilingual Biomedical Entity Linking (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) 
- Con2GEN
  - a prompt-based controllable contrastive generation framework for MBEL, which summarizes multidimensional information of the UMLS concept mentioned in biomedical text into a natural sentence following a predefined template

## Revisiting De-Identification of Electronic Medical Records: Evaluation of Within- and Cross-Hospital Generalization  (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) 
- detect and remove the protected health information from electronic medical records (EMRs)
