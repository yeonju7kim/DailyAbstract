- 충분한 빛이 있으면, visible modal이 도움됨
- the key challenges of visible and infrared images is to utilize the two modalities-between and their modality-specific noise mutually
- cross-modal pedestrian detection
  - 1）the difference between two different modalities  두 모달간의 차이
  - 2）the cross-modal detectors application to the real scene 실제 적용
- The application of cross-modal pedestrian detectors to the actual scene 
  - cost analysis-related data annotation 비용 분석 관점
  - real-time detection 실시간성
  - cost-analysis of applications 비용 분석
- The research aspects between two modalities 
  - the misalignment 
  - the inadequate fusion 적절하지 않은 fusion
- dataset
  - Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology （KAIST）
  - the forward looking infrared radiometer（FLIR）
  - the computer vision center-14（CVC-14）
  - and the low-light visible-infrared parred（LLVIP）
